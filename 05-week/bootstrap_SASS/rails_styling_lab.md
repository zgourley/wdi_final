#Rails App Styling LAB

## Bootstrap + SASS

> Bootstrap ships with vanilla CSS, but its source code utilizes the two most popular CSS **PREPROCESSORS**, Less and Sass. Quickly get started with precompiled CSS or build on the source.

---

> Bootstrap easily and efficiently scales your websites and applications with a single code base, from phones to tablets to desktops with CSS media queries.

---

> With Bootstrap, you get extensive and beautiful documentation for common HTML elements, dozens of custom HTML and CSS components, and awesome jQuery plugins.
