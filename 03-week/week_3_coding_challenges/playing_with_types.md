#PLAYING WITH TYPES
---


```JavaScript is a dynamically typed programming language. This means that you don't have to specify what kind of information a variable contains, but sometimes it's useful to know it.```

```You have to implement a typing() function that takes a parameter and is able to tell the type and value of it.```

EXAMPLE:

    typing(2);    //returns number=2
    typing(true); //returns boolean=true
