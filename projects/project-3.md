# THIRD PROJECT

It's team project time! We're staying on the Rails, but this time, you'll be partnering with two or three classmates to make a more complex project. You might have used APIs in your last project, but this time, you'll be *building* one! You'll also start to make test coverage a priority -- we'll introduce RSpec, and get you started with unit and integration tests.

The objective of this project is to:

* Work in teams and adequately balance project workload
* Learn (and appreciate) unit testing and Test-Driven Development
* Practice using relational database systems (PostgreSQL)
* Hands-on experience collaborating with other developers using Git and Github
* Learn how to create and consume APIs

You will be working **in groups** for this project, and collectively designing, pitching, and building an app. GOOOOO TEAM!

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app:

* Rails 4 + PostgreSQL
* Create an API
* Consume that API (with AngularJS, jQuery, D3, etc.)
* Log real user stories in Pivotal Tracker
* Track progress in Pivotal Tracker
* Manage team contributions on GitHub
* At least 16 model specs (across any # of models) and 8 controller specs (across any # of controllers, but at least 4 actions covered)

## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
These are for extra credit!

* Consume another team's API (or an external API)
* Execute another type of testing (user testing for UI, etc.)
* Style the app with Bootstrap, Semantic UI, or Zurb Foundation
* Implement social authentication (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)

## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables:

* Project pitch -- use a pitch deck to plan out your project, and pitch it as a team -- *due Friday, May 1*
    - [What is a Pitch Deck?](https://pitchdeck.improvepresentation.com/what-is-a-pitch-deck)
    - [Example: 6px Pitch Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/nparsons08/6px-pitch-deck)

    - [8 Tips to Create Epic Visual Presentations](https://speakerdeck.com/deckworks/8-tips-to-create-epic-visual-presentations)
* Stories in Pivotal Tracker -- what do your objectives look like, broken down into unit-sized chunks? -- *first pass due Friday, May 1
* Team GitHub repo -- must be created and have commits *due Friday, May 8 or earlier*

####Completed Project deliverables:

* Link to Heroku hosted project -- *due on demo day*
* Link to source code on GitHub -- *due on demo day*


## TIMELINE

* Project cycle: Weeks 7-9
* UXDI Collaboration Extravaganza: Wednesday, April 29
* Project pitches: Friday, May 1
* Demo day: Monday, Week 10  *(Monday, May 18)*
* Instructor Feedback: Week 10

## Team Dynamics

* Each team should support all members and provide assistance if necessary.

* Each team member should:
  * code, use Pivotal Tracker, and perform testing.  
  * be responsible for important parts of the project.
  * make a significant number of substantial GitHub commits.
  
* No member of your team can only be assigned to Pivotal Tracker and/or testing.

## Things to keep in mind

Make sure that your code is:

* Consistent. You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
* DRY and RESTful. It's the Rails way.
* Well-formatted. Are you indenting well? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* Well-commented. Will I understand what is going on in each block or function?
* Clear. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?


Weâ€™ll also be looking at:

* Quality of communication around decision-making. Did you make choices as a team and work together? Was the workload balanced? Can you all stand behind the project?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourselves. How did the team encourage each other to achieve more?
