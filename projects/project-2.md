## SECOND PROJECT

Now that you've wowed us with your class-directed Tic Tac Toe projects, it's time to show off how creative you are (all while getting practical experience with Ruby and Rails!).

The objective of this project is to:

* Practice building basic Rails apps that connect to a non-relational (Mongo) database
* Use RESTful routes
* Implement CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Destroy) functionality in an app
* Write an authentication system by hand (no gems besides BCrypt!)


You will be working **individually** for this first project, and you'll be designing the app yourself. Remember to keep things small -- scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for this project!

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* Rails 4 app with MongoDB (Mongoid gem + MongoHQ on Heroku)
* Full CRUD functionality in at least one controller
* Authentication by-hand
* RESTful routes

## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
These are for extra credit! Don't forget -- you'll need to have your base app complete before you build any of these in -- so plan for different stages of your project, including one that meets only the core requirements.

* Style your app with Bootstrap/SASS
* Have multiple models/additional controllers
* Use an API -- Google Maps, Yelp, etc
* Integrate Angular into your application


## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables, due ***PLACE DUE DATE HERE***, at the end of Week 4:

* Pitch -- sell the instructional team on your project idea (make sure that it makes sense with the objectives!)
* Stories in Pivotal Tracker -- we'll be paying closer attention this time, so be sure to keep up with your Tracker


####Completed Project deliverables, due on demo day, ***PLACE DUE DATE HERE***:

* Link to Heroku hosted project
* Link to source code on GitHub


## TIMELINE

* Project cycle: Weeks 4-6
* Demo day: ***PLACE DUE DATE HERE***, Week 7
* Code reviews: Week 7

## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code is:

* Choose an app idea that is best suited for MongoDB
* DRY. Follow Ruby best practices!
* RESTful. Do things the Rails way.
* Well-formatted. Are you indenting well? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* Well-commented. Will I understand what is going on in each block or function?
* Clear. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?


Weâ€™ll also be looking at:

* Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose
a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourself. Were you able to make the app you pitched? What makes it exceptional?
