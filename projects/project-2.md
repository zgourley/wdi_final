# PROJECT 2: RUBY ON RAILS!
Now that you've wowed us with your Tic Tac Toe projects, it's time to show off how creative you are (all while getting practical experience with Ruby and Rails!).

The objective of this project is to:

* Practice building basic Rails apps that connect to a relational database (PostgreSQL) 
* Use RESTful routes
* Implement CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Destroy) functionality in an app
* Write an authentication system by hand (no gems besides BCrypt!)


You will be working **individually** for this project, and you'll be designing the app yourself. Remember to keep things manageable -- scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for this project! You will be pitching your project idea to the instructors so that we can make sure your idea is in scope.

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app:

* Rails 4 app with PostgreSQL database
* At least two models (one of which should be a `users` model)
* Full CRUD functionality in at least one controller (not including your `users_controller`)
* Authentication by-hand, using BCrypt (NO Devise!)
* RESTful routes (at least 5)
* Use Git and Github to version control your project
* Deployed to Heroku

## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
These are for extra credit! Don't forget -- you **must** have your base app complete before you build any of these -- so plan for different stages of your project, including one that meets only the core requirements.

* Style your app with Bootstrap/SASS
* Have multiple models/additional controllers
* Use an API -- Google Maps, Yelp, etc.

## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables, due ***Friday, April 10***, at the end of Week 4:

* Pitch -- sell the instructional team on your project idea (make sure that it makes sense with the objectives!)
* User stories in Pivotal Tracker -- we'll be paying closer attention this time, so be sure to keep up with your Tracker

####Completed Project deliverables, due on demo day, ***Monday, April 27***:

* Link to Heroku hosted project
* Link to source code on GitHub

## TIMELINE

* Project cycle: Weeks 4-6
* Project pitches to instructional team: ***Friday, April 10***
* Demo day: ***Monday, April 27***, Week 7
* One-on-one feedback: Week 7

## Things to keep in mind

* DRY. Follow Ruby best practices!
* RESTful. Do things the Rails way.
* Well-formatted. Are you indenting well? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* Well-commented. Will we understand what is going on in each block or function?
* Clear. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?


Weâ€™ll also be looking at:

* Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourself. Were you able to make the app you pitched? What makes it exceptional?
