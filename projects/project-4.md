#FOURTH PROJECT

It's the final countdown! With three projects under your belt, you're ready to embark on something BIG. 

The objective of this project is to:

* Apply knowledge and skills learned throughout the course
* Push yourself further, and try something ambitious
* Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Ideally, you'll use the final three weeks of the program to venture into new territory -- go deeper with advanced Rails topics, explore new stacks, try out libraries and APIs that you haven't used yet, try different testing frameworks, etc.

We encourage you to combine the two big pieces we've learned over the course--Rails and Angular-- and put together a Single Page Application. 

You may work in teams of up to three students, but we'll be expecting more challenging projects out of teams than individuals, and you'll have to talk to an instructor to get the go-ahead. Teams will be held to the same standards of project comprehension as in Project 3 -- each individual should be able to speak confidently and accurately about how the group's app works, and note contributions from teammates.


## CORE REQUIREMENTS

Make sure to do all of the following with your app. These core requirements are less restrictive than the past three project requirements, but they're still very important.

* Custom backend (Rails, or a new one) with storage to a database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or something else, but you must store some data in some manner!)
* Custom front-end (Angular, or a new front-end framework you'd like to learn and tackle)
* Use TDD, writing tests first
* Produce user stories and scenarios, tracked with Pivotal Tracker
* Deploy your app to Heroku (or another service)
* Complete all project deliverables (specified below)

** Students must get instructor approval before using new tech stacks in a final project. All project pitches must be a web application, and we encourage you to build an API and a front-end that consumes it.


## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables:

* Project pitch -- make a solid deck to plan out your project, and pitch it to the class
* Stories in Pivotal Tracker -- what do your objectives look like from a user's perspective?
* Project wireframes
* Project GitHub repo

####Completed Project deliverables:

* Link to Heroku (or other) deployed project
* Link to source code on GitHub, with a well-documented Readme

## TIMELINE

* Project cycle: Weeks 10-12
* Pitch day: Week 10, Friday (May 22)
* Demo day: Last day of class (Friday, June 5)


## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS

These are for extra credit! Keep in mind that we're going to be looking for your core requirements first.

* Solve a real problem (do research, have users, make something that isn't a novelty app)
* Use a technology not taught in class (Node, Ember, Meteor, Sinatra, Backbone, etc**) 
* Teach a lesson module on a skill or technique you've mastered
* Make more than one final project (bonus: make yourself a portfolio site to show off your work!)

** If you want to make another app using a different stack (for example, if your main Project 4 is on Rails but you also make a Node mini-project), check with instructors first and make sure to get approval.

## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code is:

* Tested. Be thorough and smart about your testing; write tests first and code second. 
* Well-documented. Your Readme should describe what your project is, how you set it up, and how to interact with it. Include relevent links, too.
* Well-formatted. Are you indenting well? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* Well-commented. Will I understand what is going on in each block or function?
* Clear. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* Deployed and on GitHub. It's required for this project.

Weâ€™ll also be looking at:

* Planning. Did you think through your project and try to solve a real/tangible problem?
* Documentation. Is there a README? If your app is very robust or complicated, or can be built upon by other developers, is there a wiki?
* Quality of decision-making. Can you stand behind your design and coding choices? Can you think of future improvements to your app?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies and push yourselves. What did you do that took you out of your comfort zone?
