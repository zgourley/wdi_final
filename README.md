#WDI LA 12 & 13 Class Repository

This will be your shared class repo! Cheat sheets, in-class labs and code samples, curated lists of articles, and other resources will live here.


###What's in here?


**Weekly directories** contain in-class code samples and files required for labs and lessons. 

The **cheatsheets** directory will be your go-to for cheat sheets and procedural instructions (like installs, deployment steps, etc.).

The **tangents** folder is where you can find suggestions for extra practice -- ideas, prompts, specs, and more. If you need to polish your skills in a given area, you'll want to start here!

The **resources** directory is where you can find articles, blog posts, tutorials, and more ways to extend your learning or read ahead.

The **projects** directory contains information and resources for class projects.

The **templates** directory allows you to quickly create a new project using the files and directory structures we discuss in class. Throughout the class, the libraries and best practices we learn will be added to these templates.


###What can I do?

As a student, you have **pull** permissions on this repository. We recommend maintaining a "pristine" local copy (that you can keep pulling from), and a "working" directory (with another name, outside of this directory) that you can copy samples into for in-class exercises and labs.


###How do I make a copy?

Before modifying files in the repository, copy them into another folder. To do this, you can use the cp command with the -R flag, for example: <code>cp -R ~/GA/WDI_LA_12-13/templates/html5-template ~/GA/01week</code>. This will create a new html5-template/ folder inside ~/GA/01week. Including a trailing slash on the source directory will only copy the *contents* of the directory. Excluding the trailing slash, as was done in the above example, will copy the directory name and its contents.

###What am I viewing here?

You are viewing the README.md file in the current directory. It is written in [Markdown] [1] -- a plain text formatting syntax which emphasizes readability. It is recommended that you always have a README.md in the root directory of your GitHub project. For viewing and editing Markdown files on your computer, try [Mou] [2].
