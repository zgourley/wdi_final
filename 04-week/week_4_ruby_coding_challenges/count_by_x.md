Create a function with two arguments that will count by a given number (x) a certain number of times (n).

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

Return the results as an array.

***EXAMPLE***

```
countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]
```
