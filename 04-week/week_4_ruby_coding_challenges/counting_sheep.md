#COUNTING SHEEP
---

Consider an array of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

***EXAMPLE***

```
sheep = [true,  true,  true,  false,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  true,  false, true,  false,
  true,  false, false, true ,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  false, false, true,  true]
  
count_sheep(sheep) #=> returns 17 (the number of trues)
```

***HINT***

There is a built-in Ruby Array method that will do the hard work for you. Use Google!
