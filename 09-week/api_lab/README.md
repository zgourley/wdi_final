#API Lab: A Smorgasbord of Choices!

###Learning Objective
* Self-guided practice building and consuming JSON APIs using Rails and Angular

###Option 1: Lists on Lists on Lists!
Extend the functionality of our todo app by adding the ability to have multiple lists (ex. "groceries", "chores", "project 3", etc.) that each have their own todos that belong to that list. This will involve making changes to both your Rails API and your Angular app.

###Option 2: Ain't No Party Like an API Testing Party (and an API Testing Party Don't Stop)!
In the interest of focusing on the core objectives of building and consuming an API, we opted to forgo testing our Rails API. For shame! Here's your chance to right a wrong and sharpen your testing chops! Write model and integration specs to provide full test coverage for the Rails API. RSpec and Factory Girl are the recommended tools for this job!

###Option 3: Can I holler at you, girl?! / Can I holler at you, boy?!
If you are looking for more practice building and consuming a Rails API from scratch, this is the challenge for you! Your mission: build an address book to manage the, ahem, "business cards", that you collect up in the club. Build your API in Rails and build your client-side app to consume the API with Angular. Start with a manageable scope: focus on building one model (maybe call it `Contact`) that contains all the information you will need (the person's name, phone number, email address, etc). Build out full CRUD on your API and create an interface in your Angular app to take advantage of your API.

**Bonus add-on:** build your API using TDD!

###Extra Bonus Happy Funtime Challenge!
