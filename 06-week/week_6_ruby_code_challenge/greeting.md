#SPECIAL GREETING
--

Claire wants to write a function to greet her friends. But Claire REALLY likes Johnny and she wants to greet him with a special message.

Write a method that greets Johnny with the message "I love you."

***Note!*** The method should return Johnny's special message regardless of capitalization.

```
greet('Glenn')  # "Hello!"
greet('Johnny') # "I love you"
greet('johnny') # "I love you"
greet('jOhNnY') # "I love you"
```
