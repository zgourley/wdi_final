#HTML + CSS

###Skill Drills
- Circle-ize things! Use the **border-radius** property to turn a **div** into a circle or oval. Try it on an **img**!
- Clear it up! **Float** some items on a page, then bring things back to order with a **clearfix**. Try different combinations of floats (left and right) and clears.



###Mini-Projects
- Revisit your admissions website sample (the "about me" page you made!) and update it based on things you've learned at WDI.
- Get started on your portfolio page! It's never too early to think about how you want to present yourself to the world as a web developer -- write a short bio, set up a space to feature links/screenshots of your projects, and include links to your GitHub and social media pages.
- Build a three-column blog layout with a header and a footer. Use the middle column (widest) for blog posts, and the side columns for biographical info and links (to previous posts or external sites). Style it two ways; one for a personal blog and one for a professional blog.
- Have a go at this Mondrian art exercise. Take a peek at [this image](http://art-educ4kids.weebly.com/uploads/8/9/6/9/8969100/3265711_orig.jpg) and try recreating it. Practive using floats, absolute positioning, borders and what we've covered in class so far.
- Make a mock-up of your future Tic Tac Toe game board. Nine squares, in three rows and three columns. Get creative with borders, hover effecs, and more!
