#JavaScript


###Skill Drills
- Objectify all the things! Write **JS objects** based on household items. Practice **declaring** objects for your microwave, couch, pets, etc. and **accessing their properties**.
- Hide and Seek. Create an HTML page with hidden divs (CSS rule **display: none;**), and use DOM manipulation statements in the console to make those divs re-appear.


###Mini-Projects
- Chaos Theory! Write a script that you can paste into the console on any site, and set the background image of every div to a photo of Dr. Ian Malcolm. 
- Bookshelf. Write a constructor for a Book object (with properties like title, author, genre, and more). Create several Books, store them to an array, and run a loop that prints the contents of your bookshelf to the page. 
	- Level up by doing this with innerHTML instead of a document.write -- give each book a div!
- Hide and Seek with Events. Create the page noted in the Hide and Seek skill drill above, but bind the display property change to an event -- button click, mouseover, etc.
	- Turn it into a game! Count how many divs are visible on the page, and let your users know that they have ___ more divs to reveal.
	- Add a twist: set some of your click events on divs that are hidden (so they have to be revealed before others can show up).
- Prototype your Tic Tac Toe! Even though we're building our Project 1 apps in AngularJS, you can practice writing JS functions and handling events by building the game in JavaScript!
- Make another game -- figure out the rules and logic behind [Connect Four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four), [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)), [Checkers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts), or [Mastermind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))!
