#Pair Programming Code Challenges

##Learning Objectives
- Get some experience with pair programming
- Test your problem-solving skills (and your Googling skills!) by tackling some Ruby coding challenges

##Instructions
This folder contains six Ruby problems that you and your partner need to solve.

Inside the `puzzle_spec.rb` file, you will see that there are six RSpec tests that have been written.  Your job is to work with your partner to make each test pass.  

**Do not** modify any of the tests.  Instead, open `answers.rb` to write the code that will make each test pass.

To run the tests, open your terminal, navigate to the `pair_programming` directory, and run:

```
    $ rspec puzzle_spec.rb
```

The first time you run the tests, it will tell you that you have 11 examples and 11 failures.

##FYI
- You may require additional modules from Ruby's standard library inside the `answers.rb` file, if needed.  You will notice that the `base64` module has already been included in the file.
- Your first objective is to make all the tests pass.  If you finish with time remaining, go back and refactor your solutions to use fewer lines of code.  Bonus points for the most clever/novel solutions! **(At least four of the puzzles can be solved in one line of code.)**

##Resources
- Your partner
- [The Ruby Documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/)
- IRB or Pry (your Ruby console will probably be a very helpful tool as your work to solve these challenges)
