#Wireframes


>A website wireframe, also known as a **page schematic** or **screen blueprint**, is a visual guide that represents the **skeletal framework** of a **website**. ~ Wikipedia

[...continued...] **Wireframes** are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. The purpose is usually being informed by a business objective and a creative idea. The wireframe depicts the **page layout** or **arrangement** of the websiteâ€™s **content**, including **interface elements** and **navigational systems**, and how they work together. The wireframe usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main focus lies in **functionality**, behavior, and priority of content.
